    Apply a lowpass and/or a highpass Butterworth filter to an array.

    This function uses Butterworth filter designs, and implements the filter(s)
    as bi-directional digital biquad filters, split into second-order sections.

    :param df: the input data; cutoff frequencies are relative to the
        timestamps in `df.index`
    :param low_cutoff: the low-frequency cutoff, if any; frequencies below this
        value are rejected, and frequencies above this value are preserved
    :param high_cutoff: the high-frequency cutoff, if any; frequencies above
        this value are rejected, and frequencies below this value are preserved
    :param half_order: half of the order of the filter; higher orders provide
        more aggressive stopband reduction
    :return: the filtered data
